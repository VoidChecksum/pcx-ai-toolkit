# PCX Coding Discipline — How to Write Scripts, Not What They Look Like

Workflow discipline for developing Enma (`.em`) and AngelScript (`.as`) scripts on Perception.cx. Derived from the four Karpathy principles — *think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven execution* — and rewritten for the realities of cheat development: stale offsets, silent failed reads, detection surface, and overlays you debug by looking at them.

**Always active when writing or editing PCX scripts.** This is the *process* layer. The `game-cheat-guidelines` skill is the *code-shape* layer (uint64 addresses, null guards, render separation). Load both: this one tells you how to work, that one tells you what the code must look like.

**Prerequisite:** Read the relevant doc before writing any API call — see `skill://game-hacking-pcx` for the file-by-file index.

## Trigger
Writing or editing any `.em` / `.as` script, adding a cheat feature, refactoring a script, fixing a broken overlay, deciding how much to build, or judging whether a script is "done."

## 1. Think Before You Touch the Editor

**Name the target, the source of every offset, and the tradeoff you're making — out loud — before you write a line.**

The single most expensive habit in cheat development is writing code against assumptions. A wrong offset doesn't throw; it reads garbage and your ESP draws at (0, 0). Before implementing:

- **State the target.** Game, engine, module. "Apex / Source (r5) / `r5apex.exe`."
- **State where each offset comes from.** Sig scan, SDK header, or hardcode — and say which. If you're guessing a struct field, write `// UNVERIFIED` next to it.
- **Surface the tradeoff the user didn't ask about.** Read-only ESP is invisible; a memory write for aimbot is a detection surface. Per-frame reads are simple but couple render to read latency. Say which you're choosing and why.
- **If the doc is ambiguous or the API is permission-gated, stop and read it.** Do not invent `draw_esp()` or assume `draw_circle` takes a fill flag. Open `docs/perception/render-api.md`.

```
Before: "I'll write an ESP overlay."
        *invents function names, assumes int32 offsets, no W2S behind-camera check*

After:  "Target: Apex / Source (r5). Entity list via sig (UNVERIFIED layout, r5sdk season 21).
         Read-only ESP, per-frame W2S — accepting read/render coupling for v1 simplicity.
         Reading render-api.md + lifecycle-and-routines.md before writing."
```

**Why:** Confusion hidden behind plausible code costs hours. Confusion stated up front costs one sentence and gets corrected before it compiles into a silent bug.

## 2. The Simplest Cheat That Works

**Build the minimum feature that satisfies the ask. Nothing speculative.**

Cheat scripts rot into 2000-line monoliths because every feature arrives with prediction, smoothing, themes, and a config framework nobody requested. Climb down the ladder:

- **"Highlight enemies" is a box, not a skeleton-ESP-with-bones-and-LOD.** Ship the box. Add bones when asked.
- **An aimbot the user described as "snap to head" doesn't need velocity prediction.** Don't add it.
- **No config system for a value that never changes.** A fixed enemy color is `color(255,0,0,255)`, not a JSON-loaded theme engine.
- **No abstraction over the proc API.** `p.ru64(...)` is the interface. Wrapping it in a `MemoryManager` class buys nothing.
- **No "feature manager" framework for three features.** Three registered routines is the framework.

```cpp
// WRONG — entity-component scaffolding for "draw boxes on enemies"
class IFeature { void update(); void render(); }
class FeatureRegistry { array<IFeature@> features; ... }
class EspFeature : IFeature { /* 200 lines */ }

// RIGHT — two routines, done
void on_update(int64 data) { /* read positions into g_positions */ }
void on_render(int64 data) { /* draw boxes from g_positions */ }
```

**Why:** Every speculative line is a line someone debugs at 3am after a patch. The lazy version ships today and is trivially extended when a real second requirement shows up — which is the only honest signal that the abstraction was needed.

---

## 3. Surgical Edits — One Feature, One Diff

**When changing a script, touch only the feature you're changing. Clean up only the mess your change makes.**

Perception scripts are built for hot reload precisely so you can change one file without disturbing the rest. Honor that:

- **Editing ESP color? Edit `esp.em`.** Do not reformat `menu.em`, rename globals in `globals.em`, or "tidy" `main.em` while you're in there.
- **Match the module's existing style** — naming, the per-feature file split, the order of routine registration. A second convention beside the first is worse than the style you'd have picked.
- **If your change orphans a global or import, remove it.** If you spot pre-existing dead code unrelated to your change, mention it — don't delete it.
- **Don't churn working offsets.** A sig that still hits and resolves to valid data is not your problem today.

```
Task: "the enemy boxes are the wrong color"

WRONG diff:  esp.em (color)  +  globals.em (renamed g_col → g_enemyColor)
             +  menu.em (reordered widgets)  +  main.em (reformatted)

RIGHT diff:  esp.em (color)
```

**Why:** Every file you touch is a file that can break and a file the next reader has to diff. A four-file diff to change one color hides the actual change and risks the three features you didn't mean to touch.

## 4. Done Means It Works on the Target

**Define success as something you can *see* on the live game, then loop until you see it. Compiling is not done.**

A script that compiles has proven nothing about whether the offsets are right, the W2S matches the engine, or the overlay aligns. Set a concrete bar and verify against it:

- **Write the success criteria before coding**, as observable facts: "boxes track enemies at any distance, nothing draws behind the camera, count matches the scoreboard."
- **The overlay is your debugger.** When something's off, draw the raw W2S coordinates and `print` the entity count — don't guess.
- **Loop:** compile → load → look at the screen → compare to the criteria → fix → reload. Repeat until every criterion holds.
- **When the IDB, the SDK, and the live read disagree, trust the live read** (see `game-cheat-guidelines` #12). The SDK may be from an older season.

```
Success criteria for "enemy ESP":
[ ] A box appears on every enemy entity (count == live enemy count)
[ ] Boxes track movement smoothly, no stutter
[ ] No box renders when the entity is behind the camera (W2S w > 0)
[ ] No box at (0,0) — that means a null read slipped a guard
[ ] Boxes scale with distance (far enemies = smaller boxes)
```

**Why:** "It compiles" and "it works" are different claims, and only the second one is the deliverable. A success checklist turns a vague "make ESP" into a loop you can run yourself without asking the user whether it's right.

## Summary

| # | Principle (Karpathy) | In PCX terms |
|---|----------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Think Before Coding | Name target, offset source, and tradeoff before the first line |
| 2 | Simplicity First | Ship the box, not the framework — no speculative features |
| 3 | Surgical Changes | One feature, one diff; clean only your own orphans |
| 4 | Goal-Driven Execution | Done = visible success criteria met on the live target, not "compiles" |
